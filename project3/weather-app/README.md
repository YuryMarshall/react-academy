# Project 3 - Weather App:

To run app in developer mode use `npm install`
after run app with `npm start` in terminal

Be aware that React Strict mode doesn't allow to get API data, due double render!
For correct developing please remove `<React.StrictMode>` and left only `<App />` in `src/index.js`

# App using:

`React`
`Tailwind`
`Eslint`
`Prettier`
`[OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)`
`[IpGeolocation API](https://ipgeolocation.io/)`

# Created by Kalashnik Yury as training project for CDG react courses
